## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

My knowledge grew a little further with @media, which is somewhere I struggle. Also, first time using SASS/SCSS on my own. I obtained a better understanding for it. 

### Continued development

I am looking forward to getting more practice with SASS/SCSS and improving my organization. I love the idea behind it. Also, I think im getting the hang of utilizing @media to adjust for mobile->desktop.
